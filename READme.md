# **Getting Started:**

**In order to run locally:**


- **Node.js** needs to be installed on your OS
- Clone the **webhook-display** [repo](https://github.com/Tidelaw/webhook-display.git)
- Start the project
    1. Run `npm install` to install all our project's dependencies
    2. Run `npm run dev` to run our application


`npm install` downloads the packages found in **package.json**

`npm run dev` runs the website. The website can now be accessed from `localhost:3000` or `0.0.0.0`

In order for the dAPP to work, a webhook is necessary - in order to set one up, visit
